// This file is used by Code Analysis to maintain SuppressMessage 
// attributes that are applied to this project.
// Project-level suppressions either have no target or are given 
// a specific target and scoped to a namespace, type, member, etc.

// These arise from modifications to existing API. The analysis seems too strict as the first
// required parameter type is different for all overloads and so there is no ambiguity.
